## Significant Changes

The current drafting baseline is [Volume 1](volume-1.html). Supporting content reflects four actors, four transactions, policy, execution plan, FHIR payload, evidence, and lookup table specifications, the nine core transformation actions, and independently versioned R4/R5/R6 payloads over an R4 protocol binding. R6 support remains provisional as described in Volume 1.

## Issues

### Submit an Issue

Submit and discuss profile feedback through [IHE ITI.DIS GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.DIS/issues). The repository development work plan records drafting packages and dependencies; it does not establish that all bindings or tests are complete.

### Open Issues

- [Data Recipient actor and push delivery](#data-recipient-and-push-delivery)
- **[DICOM and CDA binding conformance](draft-native-payload-bindings.html):** complete native policy and plan schemas, capabilities, output and evidence mappings, and cross-set linkage rules for use cases that require shared identifiers.
- [Future policy management transaction](#future-policy-management-transaction)
- **Draft contract review:** confirm the payload set transaction contract, capability declarations, stage ordering, and release authorization. Complete detailed conformance procedures and validate them against the agreed baseline.

#### Data Recipient Actor and Push Delivery

In [UC-5](volume-1.html#1pxx425-use-case-5-de-identified-health-data-export-content-conformance), the standalone Integrated actor produces de-identified output through local invocation and delivers it through an implementation-defined mechanism. A Connectathon can assess content conformance by inspecting the output artifacts.

An alternative design would introduce a **Data Recipient** actor and an optional push-delivery transaction initiated by the Integrated actor (or De-ID Manager) to deliver de-identified output directly to the recipient. The proposal would have these effects.

- Give the content-conformance-only Integrated actor a wire-testable transaction, enabling connectathon testing with a test partner
- Standardize the output delivery step that UC-1, UC-2, and UC-5 currently describe as outside DIS
- Separate the job-initiation role (Requester) from the output-consumption role (Data Recipient), reflecting deployments where the exporting system and the downstream consumer are different systems

Considerations include Phase 1 scope, overlap with MHD Document Source grouping (see [Volume 1 MHD grouping](volume-1.html#1pxx63-ihe-mhd---mobile-access-to-health-documents)), additional specification and testing surface, and whether a content-only connectathon test is sufficient for the standalone Integrated actor.

**The committee is asked to discuss whether a Data Recipient actor and push-delivery transaction should be included in Phase 1.**

#### Future Policy Management Transaction

A future phase could standardize policy discovery, retrieval, and lifecycle management through a transaction such as ITI-x8. Phase 1 uses implementation-defined mechanisms under the [policy lifecycle rules](volume-3.html#3pxx16-policy-lifecycle).
